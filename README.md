  ## Description
    I built this project to condense the amount of time spent making future readmes. 
    By eliminating the need to worry about formatting, this app will allow for readmes that are 
    comprehensive and professional in  no time at all. I learned a lot about  asynchronous functions 
    overlapping, and how most importantly, how to stop the app from running right passed them without 
    waiting for the function to finish.

  ## Installation
    to install, simply clone this repo to your hardrive and run it in the commandline. 

  ## Usage
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sBAKU0OdMzBMnz5npQDf1skD8Uv7hxYE/view
    to use, run node index.js in an integrated terminal. 
    then follow the prompts, answering the questions until they finish. 
    You should get a "file printed successfully message" once the process is finished. 
    As always, it is reccomended to look over the generated read me and fine tune it to your 
    specifications. there is a chance things like links and images could get lost 
    in the imperfect commandline input format. 

  ## How to Contribute
    to contribute, simply fork and PR and I will look it over. Always open to outside contribution

  ## Tests
    the best test is simply to run the application! clone it, and run it, throw some sample text into the inputs, 
    see what the file that is generated looks like! For instance, this very README is generated using the application!
